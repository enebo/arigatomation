= Windows automation in Ruby

Partial port of a larger automation library I have been using on windows to automate actions of moving a mouse, clicking a mouse, or automating key-presses.  At this point the first commit will merge my win32ole automation with the Autoit automation library.  The second phase will incorporate a more direct FFI binding to user32, kernel32, and gdi32.

No docs nor examples for now...
